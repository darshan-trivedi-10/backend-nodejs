# JavaScript
* What is Javascript ?
  * It is a multi purpose & multi paradigm programming language.
* Types of values in JS
  * Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Number, and Object.
* Operators in JS 
  * Arithmetic Operators (+  -   /   *  ++  --  %)
  * Comparison (Relational) Operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
  * Bitwise Operators (& , |, ^, ~, <<, >>, )
  * Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
  * Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=)
  * Special Operators (**, ?:)
     
* what is *`typeof`* in JS
   *  typeof <value> is return the type of the values in string format.
      * typeof 12 --> Number 
      * typeof true --> boolean 
      * typeof "abc" --> string
      * typeof undefined --> undefined

* Variables are buckets in the memory which store values.
    * let x = 10; // here 10 let is a keyword and x is a variable name. 
 
* console.log(typeof(typeof(12)) // String 
   * It will print string because typeof(12) return "Number" and "Number" is a string so typeof("Number") is a string.
